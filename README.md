In this repository, I will be adding my own data science projects, mostly Python files on topics like Linear Regression, Clustering, Principal Component Analysis, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and so on. I will also share some python files and associated notes (if available) on topics of marketing analytics like cohort analysis, customer segmentation, customer churn prediction, RFM analysis and so on.
