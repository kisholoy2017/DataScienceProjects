In this repository, I will be adding my own data science projects, mostly Python files on topics like Linear Regression, Clustering, Principal Component Analysis, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and so on. I will also share some python files and associated notes (if available) on topics of marketing analytics like cohort analysis, customer segmentation, customer churn prediction, RFM analysis and so on.
Disclaimer: I don't claim ownership of these codes. In fact, in several cases, the codes are directly taken from other sources like Youtube tutorials or books or other material. The purpose was just to practice and learn. At best, at times I have altered the code slightly to try new things. So thanks to the wonderful community of Python developers and mentors.
